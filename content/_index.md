### Lonely Hackers Club Community Room at DEF CON
As you may know, we have a community room at DEF CON this year! We are planning on hosting a few events and we will be doing prizes as well! 

We are working on the schedule but just a little insight: We are planning on doing Resume Reviews again, Name The Noob and Egorâ€™s contest to name a few. Stay tuned for more updates!

### LHC Shop
LHC is an official DEF CON Community this year! ðŸ¥³ We've setup an [LHC shop]({{< relref "shop" >}}) to help offset expenses so we can do really cool things! 100% of all proceeds will be used towards the LHC Community for DEF CON.
